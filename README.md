## Data

- **Administrative data**: SIAB worker histories and BHP plant-level information (remote access via FDZ IAB).  
- **Supplementary data**: Destatis (national accounts, employment, CPI), KLEMS, and union coverage (IAB Establishment Panel).  
- **Note**: Access to restricted FDZ data requires an approved project. Only small derived datasets and public sources are stored in `smalldata/`.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preparation and textual analysis output in logs(Stata)**  
   - Run the scripts in `FDZ1489/` via josua (starting from `master.do`)
   - Produces raw output of the Ppaer analyses saved in logs

2. **Analysis (R)**  
   - Core functions in `functions/` provide factor definitions, general utilities, and plotting helpers.
   - `paper_plots.R` reproduces the figures for the manuscript.
   - `prepare_KLEMS.R` and `retrieve_destatis_data.R` handle additional external datasets.

## Paper Abstract

We analyze the evolution of the wage structure in East Germany over the past two decades and compare it to West Germany. Wage inequality rose in both regions between 1995 and 2009, with dispersion in East Germany exceeding that of the West, especially at the top. Since 2009, inequality has leveled off and even declined in the East, largely due to sectoral minimum wages. Union decline, in contrast, played a limited role in East Germany. Demand-side forces account for much of the rise in top-end inequality:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
